NFA simulator with epsilon moves
==========

Solution for the first lab at "Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science" course - Nondeterministic finite automata
simulator with epsilon transitions/moves.

    Bad practice alert: All classes are in the same (default) package because assignment told so (probably because of tests
    they would run afterwards to test the solution).
